# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Learnings

1. `ord()` gives an [ASCII Decimal Code](https://www.asciitable.com/) of a character.
2. `random.choice()` generates a random item from a list.
3. `isalpha()` checks if a character is alphabetical.

## Milestones

[x] Set up the environment.
[x] Create the variables for the game.
